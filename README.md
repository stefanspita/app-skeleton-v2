## Steps I took to create it
1) Install Node
- Go through the standard installation of Node for your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- I would always choose the LTS version (long term support). The latest version is less stable, so only use it if you are an advanced user or you are interested in trying out experimental features
- Restart your command line if you had it open
- At the end of the installation you should be able to run `node --version` from your command line and get the version number you had just installed. Please ask me for help if you haven't. This is an important step to get right. Not installing Node with the right permissions or in the right place will greatly affect your development experience

2) Create a git repository
- Add a new repository in your github account, using the github interface
- clone your repository using ```git clone git@github.com:[github-username]/[repository-name]```

3) Initialize npm
- in your command line, navigate into your newly cloned repository and run ```npm init```. Complete the wizard that follows. If you're not sure what any of the questions mean, just press ENTER to use the default recommended values.
